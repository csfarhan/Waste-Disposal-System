## Executive Summary
As large amounts of garbage are sent to recycling facilities, an extremely large number of recyclable materials are not recycled properly. With the current recycling situation, recycling bins full of recyclable material are often deemed contaminated if a singular piece of garbage is present, and the entire contents of the bin is thrown into landfill. Rather than just sitting in landfills taking up space, depending on the material of these objects, they can be repurposed and reused which stops further fabrication of the same objects. We believe this is an easy fix, and an extremely important one to make. This issue of not dealing with recyclable materials properly was a huge motivation for use while developing our system. We realized how detrimental our current system for sorting and recycling materials is on our environment. We believe an autonomous sorting station using robotic arms, terrestrial drones, and a mechanism to release these recyclables will solve this issue.  

A more reliable and efficient method for sorting recyclables will have a positive impact on our environment. Which is why we believe our system will revolutionize the future of garbage disposal and help reduce pollution and save the planet. Recycling helps us preserve our natural resources along with the protection of our environment. For our design solution, we have developed a system to sort through the garbage and recycling to ensure all recyclable materials are dealt with properly and effectively. We have programmed a sorting station to detect, measure and sort various objects to be recycled properly. We have also constructed a simple but reliable hopper mechanism to transfer and dispose of the various objects into their respective bins.  

In the virtualized environment provided, we assigned each of the 4 bins a specific ID and color as each bin will recycle the contents differently. The various bottles dispensed are categorized by material and weighed to determine if they contain contaminants like leftover food waste inside. Once these factors have been considered, the algorithm we developed figures out if the containers are recyclable or not and which bins they need to go into to ensure they are being recycled properly. Our programmed Q-arm transfers the bottles onto the hopper we developed, and the programmed Q-bot transfers the bottles to the correct bin using a color sensor. 

The mechanism to dispense the bottles into the bin was designed on Autodesk Inventor and a dynamic simulation was implemented to ensure its functionality. The hopper is raised by a rod pushing beneath it and raises it to an almost vertical angle with a slide inside the hopper to allow all shapes and sizes of bottles to fall out, so none get stuck. This movement was created by transforming linear motion from a linear actuator to a smooth curved motion which lifts the hopper up and was brought back down by gravity. The design was finalized by ensuring that the dynamic simulation worked without any interference.

## Refined Problem Statement

Due to the excess amount of garbage being sent to recycling facilities only 9% of recyclable materials are recycled, this produces large amounts of harmful waste in our country. A new mechanism is needed for recycling facilities to accurately identify and sort through recyclable materials and properly place them into their designated bins to reduce harmful waste.
